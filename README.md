# GHS-label template for Latex

Inspiration: to get chemicals in my university, you have to label them correctly. 

Therefore I created based on Rolands's template/work: https://rsmith.home.xs4all.nl/howto/ghs-labels-in-latex.html my personal template with a little bit more spacing.

note: I compile with lualatex, language changes can be easily done, see comments in .tex file
